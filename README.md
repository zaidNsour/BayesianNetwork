# Bayesian Network Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a Bayesian network in Java, providing a framework for modeling probabilistic relationships between variables in a complex system. The Bayesian network serves as a powerful tool for reasoning under uncertainty and making predictions based on observed evidence.

## Key Features

- **Design and Implementation**: The project includes classes to represent random variables, conditional probability distributions, and the Bayesian network itself, implemented from scratch in Java.
- **Functionality**: Methods are provided to calculate joint probabilities of variables given their values and to make predictions based on observed evidence.
- **Efficiency and Optimization**: The implementation ensures efficient computation of probabilities through algorithmic optimizations and optimal data structures usage.
- **Documentation and Testing**: Extensive documentation is provided, including class descriptions, method functionalities, and usage examples. The project has been thoroughly tested to ensure correctness and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-oriented programming
- Data structures and algorithms

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bayesian-network.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd bayesian-network
   ```
3. **Compile the Java Files**:
    ```bash
   javac bayesian/*.java
   ```
4. **Run the Main Program**:
    ```bash
   java bayesian.Main
   ```

## Future Directions

- Enhance the Bayesian network by incorporating additional features such as learning algorithms for model refinement and scalability improvements for handling larger datasets.

- Expand the project with advanced inference techniques and visualization tools for better understanding and analysis of the Bayesian network.
